## About

My name is Ivy Awuor and I am a researcher, an engineer, and a student :) I am currently pursuing my masters degree in Electrical Engineering
at the University of Rochester.

Originally from Nairobi, Kenya, I started my adventures in Engineering at the University of Rochester where I received my Bachelors degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Prior to 
my graduation, I spent a few summers working with professors on various research projects both at the University of Rochester and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. My long term goal 
is to establish a career in engineering research.

Apart from being a <strike>awesome human</strike> nerd, I enjoy cooking, learning new languages and different cultures, watching korean dramas and playing Candy Crush :)
I'm more of an indoors person, but I compromise for three things 1: Money - I need to go to work :) 2: Good company: Yeah, I'll hang out with you if you're not dangerous :) 
3:Ice cream: I'll definitely get ice-cream when I run out :)
Often times, I get too carried away and I do some ranting here...just in case, please know that all opinions expressed here are my own :)
