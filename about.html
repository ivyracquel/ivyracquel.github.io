## About

##Thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case it does, at least I tried.
##Originally from Athens, Greece, I started my adventures in Computer Science and Technology from University of Athens where I received my Bachelor in Computer Science and Master in Software Engineering.
##Between those, I spent a creative year in Geneva, Switzerland where I worked at CERN as a Computer Security researcher.
##While attending my master's, I was working as a Machine Learning researcher for the <a href="http://kddlab.di.uoa.gr/" target="_blank">KDD</a> lab, supervised by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PHJokEQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Dimitrios Gunopulos</a>.
##During my last summer break of my studies, I moved to Oslo, Norway, as an intern for Microsoft Development Center Norway.
##That place won me and became my first working place in my post-academic life.

##But, apart from being a <strike>cool guy</strike> geek,
##I enjoy playing and composing music, messing with hardware, playing <a href="http://deck.tk/43TX9icn" target="_blank">card games</a>, yo-yoing and collecting comic books and vinyls.
##In general, my mind can zone out during any form of creative act. Opinions expressed here are mine.

My name is Ivy Awuor and I am a researacher, an engineer, and a student :) I am currently pursuing my masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering
at the University of Rochester.

Originally from Nairobi, Kenya, I started my adventures in Engineering at the University of Rochester where I received my Bachelors degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Prior to 
my graduation, I spent a few summers working with professors on various research projects both at the University of Rochester and the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. My long term goal 
is to establish a career in engineering research.

Apart from being a <strike>cool girl</strike> nerd, I enjoy cooking, learning new languages & different cultures, watching korean dramas and playing Candy Crush :)
I'm more of an indoors person, but I compromise for three things 
1: Money - I need to go to work :) 
2: Good company: I'd never say no to good company :) 
3:Ice cream: I'll definitely get ice-cream when I run out :)
Often times, I get too carried away and I do some ranting here...just in case, please know that all opinions expressed here are my own :)
